I am a Brazilian data scientist and economist expatriate in Paris. I love analyzing data and applying clever statistical methods to answer for real world questions. I am also the developer of the #*sfcr* package for simulating and validating stock-flow consistent models with R.

I love football, economics, literature, and statistics, not necessarily in that order.
